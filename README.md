# ALAB 308.1.1: Data Manipulation with JavaScript

### Introduction
This assignment will walk you through a few small activities to familiarize you with data manipulation and processing using JavaScript. By becoming more familiar with the logic behind programming decisions, you will be able to create more efficient solutions in the future.
Objectives
Create variable declarations using both let and const.
Apply different types of data literals.
Use arithmetic operators to manipulate data.
Use comparison operators to compare data.
Perform string concatenations.
Implement escape sequences in strings for special characters.
Use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
Create effective documentation through the use of comments.
Submission
Submit your completed lab using the Start Assignment button on the assignment page in Canvas.
Your submission should include:
A GitHub link to your completed project repository.
### Instructions
Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder and create a JavaScript file (.js) to contain your code. Within your code editor of choice (we recommend Visual Studio Code), complete the following activities.
Use comments within your file to separate the code for each activity. Also use comments throughout the code to increase readability and explain your process where necessary. You can also use comments to make notes for yourself if you cannot figure something out and need to return to it at a later time.
Commit frequently! Every time something works, you should commit it. Remember, you can always go back to a previous commit if something breaks. As an optional goal, create a separate branch for each of the activities and merge it into your main branch when you are finished with that activity.
